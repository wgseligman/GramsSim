This program is a simulation of the electronics response to the detector readout, including noise and shaping. It sums the energy deposited into each readout pixel as a function of time, and generates waveform simulations for each pixel. 

Note that `gramselecsim` uses a random-number generator for its noise and pre-amp operations. When running this program as part of grid or batch job, you probably want to set up a process-based value for option `rngseed` as mentioned in [GramsSim/README.md](../README.md). For example, assuming that the individual process ID is stored in variable `${Process}`:

    ./gramselecsim --rngseed=${Process}
    
## `GramsElecSim` simulations

See `GramsSim/util/README.md` for a description of how to control the
operation of `gramsdetsim` through the [`options.xml`](../options.xml) file and the
command line.

- `timebin_width`: The minimal time interval over which the readout can can respond to a charge.

- `time_window`: The total time interval over which charge would be sampled once the electronics are triggered. 

The output of `gramselecsim` includes both the analog and digital versions of the waveforms created by summing the charges accumulated at each readout pixel. Units of the analog waveform are millivolts. 

There are three segments of the electronics response modeled by `gramselecsim`.

### Noise fluctuations

The number of electrons arriving at given pixel is adjusted by:

where

- &Nu;<sub>i</sub> is the number of electrons in an electron cluster;
- &Nu;<sub>i</sub><sup>'</sup> is the noise-adjusted number of electrons;
- <em>N</em>(0,1) is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and width of 1;
- <em>c</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>c</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>c</em><sub>2</sub> are the parameters `noise_param0`, `noise_param1`, and `noise_param2` respectively. 

### Shaping and pre-amplification

Each group of electrons is treated as a delta function which must be shaped by a response function. The parameters that affect this process are:

- `preamp_prior_time`: The rise time of the response function.
- `preamp_post_time`: The decay time of the response function.
- `peak_delay`: The delay between the arrival of the electron cluster and the peak of the response function.
- `preamp_gain`: The amplitude of the response function. 

The parameter `preamp_func` selects which response function to use:

0 -> A gaussian distribution normalized to unity:

1 -> A gaussian distribution:

<img src="Gauss.png" width="46" />

2 -> The log of a normalized gaussian distribution:

<img src="LogNormGauss.png" width="118" />

3 -> The log of a gaussian:

<img src="LogGauss.png" width="62" />

4 -> A double exponential function:

<img src="TwoExp.png" width="180" />

where <em>&sigma;</em>, <em>&tau;</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>&tau;</em><sub>2</sub> are the parameters `preamp_sigma`, `preamp_tau1`, and `preamp_tau2` respectively. 

### Analog-to-digital conversion

The last step is to take the summed response functions for the accumulated electrons and apply the effects of analog-to-digital (ADC) conversion. 

The parameters that affect this procedure are:

- `sample_freq`: The analog values are scaled from time bins whose width was determined by `timebin_width` to the ADC bins whose width is determined by `sample_freq`. 

- `input_max` and `input_min`: The signal is then clipped at the high and low ends by these two parameters. The parameter `input_min` also effectively serves as the ADC pedestal. 

- `bit_resolution`: The last step is to convert the floating-point value from the previous steps into a number of ADC counts, as determined by the `bit_resolution` parameter.


## Design note

It's reasonable to ask why the functions of GramsDetSim,
GramsReadoutSim, and GramsElecSim are in three separate prograsm.

Functionally, each of these programs relates to a different aspect of
an experiment's simulation:

   - GramsDetSim relates to the physics of charge transport in the detector.

   - GramsReadoutSim relates to the geometry of the readout anode.

   - GramsElecSim relates to the design of the data-acquisition electronics.

Experience has taught us that for the purpose of planning, testing,
studies, and maintenance, it's best to have these functions in
separate programs, rather than one large program.
