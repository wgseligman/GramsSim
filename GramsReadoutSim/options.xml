    <!-- The parameters in this section are meant to apply to all the
         programs. However, you can ovverride them within the
         individual program blocks, though it's probably more useful
         to override them on the command line. Be careful about what
         you're overriding, especially the unit options. -->

        If you want to, you can include text like this within an option
        tag. You can use this for additional documentation. The program
        does not read or interpret it.

         Length unit: as of Jan-2022, the only valid values are "cm" and "mm".
         Energy unit: as of Jan-2022, the only valid values are "MeV" and "GeV".
	 Time unit: as of Jan-2022, the only valid values are "ns", "ms", and "s".
     
         Note that this does not directly affect the GDML file and
         Geant4 macro files, as any dimensioned quantities in those
         files have units specified explicitly.
