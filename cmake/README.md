# cmake scripts

_If you want a formatted (or easier-to-read) version of this file, scroll to the bottom of [`GramsSim/README.md`](../README.md) for instructions. If you're reading this on github, then it's already formatted._

Like most "cmake" directories within a distribution, this directory
contains build scripts for packages that are external to the main
distribution described in [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt).

Pretty much everything in this directory is copied from Beam Delivery
Simulation (BDSIM), developed at the University of London.

`ROOT.cmake` - As the name suggests, set up compilation with ROOT.

`HepMC3.cmake` - Set up compilation with HepMC3.
