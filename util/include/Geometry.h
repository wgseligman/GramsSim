    // This is a utility function to take a file in GDML format,
    // convert it to ROOT's TGeoManager format, and append the
    // geometry to a ROOT file.

    // The arguments are:

    // gdmlFile = The name of the input geometry file in GDML
    // format. Note that this file must either have been written by
    // Geant4's G4GDMLParser, or it must be fully ROOT-compatible (no
    // formulas or loops). If this is empty, this value will be taken
    // from the 'gdmlout' parameter in Options.

    // rootFile = The name of the output ROOT file into which the
    // TGeoManager structure will be written. If this is empty, this
    // will be taken from the 'outputfile' parameter in Options.

    // geometry = The name of the TGeoManager structure when it is
    // written to 'rootFile'. If this is empty, this will be taken
    // from the 'geometry' parameter in Options.

    // Note that both gdmlFile and rootFile should be closed before
    // invoking this routine, as GDML2ROOT will open these files; in
    // particular, rootFile will be opened in "UPDATE" mode.

    // This routine will probably only ever be called from a Geant4
    // simulation after all files are closed anyway, near the end of
    // the 'main' routine. It's primarily within this class just in
    // case there is another use-case for it.
